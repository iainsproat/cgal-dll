From the [http://www.cgal.org CGAL] project website:

  The goal of the CGAL Open Source Project is to provide easy access to efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++ library

When compiling the [http://www.cgal.org/download.html CGAL source code], on windows CGAL is compiled to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_library static library].

Unfortunately, binding to CGAL from other languages is often not possible as most binding frameworks require a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library dynamic-link library] (dll).

This project aims to provide a dll for CGAL.

= Pre-requisites =

 * You will be building CGAL and CGAL-dll from source, and should be familiar with compiling C++ projects from source using cmake and make.

 * You should have downloaded the CGAL sources and dependencies, and have built the CGAL library.  Detailed instruction for this are available at the [http://www.cgal.org/Manual/latest/doc_html/installation_manual/contents.html CGAL website].
