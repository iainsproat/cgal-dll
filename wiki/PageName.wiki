From the [http://www.cgal.org CGAL] project website:

  "The goal of the CGAL Open Source Project is to provide easy access to efficient and reliable geometric algorithms in the form of a C++ library"

When compiling the [http://www.cgal.org/download.html CGAL source code], on windows CGAL is compiled to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_library static library].

Unfortunately, binding to CGAL from other languages is often not possible as most binding frameworks require a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library dynamic-link library] (dll).

This project aims to provide a dll for CGAL.

= Prerequisites =

 * You will be building CGAL and CGAL-dll from source, and should be familiar with compiling C++ projects from source using cmake and make.

 * You should have downloaded the CGAL sources and dependencies, and have built the CGAL library.  Detailed instruction for this are available at the [http://acg.cs.tau.ac.il/cgal-at-tau/installing-cgal-and-related-programs-on-windows CGAL website].
